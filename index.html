<div id='text1'><a>and then we started talking about Pride and like my chair got sweaty and I made eye contact with every single person in the room like suddenly I was a hyena that wanted to eat them but they wouldn't let me and
</a></div>

<div id='text2'><a>
I said idk how I feel about straight people going to pride without being invited and the swarm of Manuka honey dripping bees start getting closer
</a></div>

<div id='text3'><a>
they are allies they

go to support and

they start clawing at my chair

but no
</a></div>

<div id='text7'><a>
I get that
</a></div>

<div id='text8'><a>
but
</a></div>

<div id='text9'><a>
like I just don't understand
how exactly you are supporting by just being there
</a></div>

<div id='text10'><a>
 and having a really fun time
</a></div>

<div id='text11'><a>
and then living your life as normal
</a></div>

<div id='text12'><a>
but no I am an ally
</a></div>

<div id='text13'><a>
yes I know
</a></div>

<div id='text14'><a>
you are forcing your nails into the side of my ribcage and taking a photo for instagram
</a></div>

<div id='text15'><a>
I am very much aware
</a></div>

<div id='text4'><a>
You are here as an ally
</a></div>

<div id='text16'><a>
but
</a></div>

<div id='text17'><a>
Do you see how the parade is playing an advertisement for Primark
	How there is a snapping sound under the floats the a large collection of branches
no
</a></div>

<div id='text18'><a>
I must be misunderstanding
</a></div>

<div id='text19'><a>
they are here to support
</a></div>

<div id='text20'><a>
my chair is breaking under the weight of all those alcoholic lemonades
we keep drinking the last time I went to pride
</a></div>

<div id='text21'><a>
a boy talked about fucking my friend in the bathroom
but I must of misunderstood
because he was there as an ally I'm sure yes I must be wrong
</a></div>

<div id='text22'><a href='https://queerspaces.github.io/housewives/' style="color:#f22ecb">ugh its just so much easier and sit in
silence and watch real housewives with the ones i love!</a></div>

<div id='text23'><a href='https://queerspaces.github.io/camp/' style="color:#b8e6e1">or maybe u just need a breath of fresh air</a></div>
